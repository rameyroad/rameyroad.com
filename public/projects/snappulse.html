        width="368" />CCL SnapPulse&trade; is a digital tool that allows leaders to set development goals and
    periodically "pulse" their colleagues for feedback on their progress. These small, pulse surveys are used to
    anonymously deliver guidance for the leader that helps them achieve their professional development goals.</p>
<p>SnapPulse began in the spring of 2019 and integrated in pilot programs throughout the fall. It was approved for
    production release in early 2020.</p>
<p>I was the lead architect and developer on SnapPulse. I oversaw a team of 1 developer and 2 qa team members.</p>
