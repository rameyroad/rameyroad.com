        width="368" height="178" />CCL Compass&trade; is a digital tool that distills and organizes more than 50 years
    of leadership expertise, creating personalized strategies that help leaders build on strengths and improve in areas
    of development.&nbsp;CCL Compass brings development to life so it means something real and helps people move
    forward.</p>
<p>Compass began in 2017 as a tool to allow leaders to review their 360 assessment results using integrated, online
    charts, which allowed them to quickly identify strengths and/or weaknesses, and determine priority areas for
    development based peer and boss feedback. When equipped with this information, the leaders were able to create a
    customized plan for development based on 50+ well-researched chapters of guidance and practical steps for developing
    competencies and avoiding career derailers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Compass became the centerpiece of CCL's retail assessement products. Purchases of 360 assessments included a
    one year subscription to allow users to take their assessments and develop specific plans for development. This
    resulted in a significant increase in year over year assessment revenue.</p>
<p>I was the lead architect and developer on Compass and it's supporting systems, which included integration with
    Piranha CMS and the development and use of multiple REST APIs for consolidating and displaying assessment results.
