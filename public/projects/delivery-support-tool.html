        alt="CCL" />Delivery Support Tool (DST) is a project that began in Fall 2019 to consolidate multiple, separate
    CCL web applications into a single platform for managing CCL event operations. The separate applications were used
    by CCL faculty, operations staff, coaches, and retail assessment facilitators. The goal was to create a single,
    unified platform for managing CCL operations without creating a single, monolithic application that would increase
    maintenance complexity.</p>
<p>I led the team that implemented DST in the winter &amp; spring of 2020. The project included creating a DST theme
    that incorporated all CCL branding standards and approved colors while providing a unified look and feel for all
    pages of the application. I identified the theme for purchase, customized it to CCL's specifications, and led the
    implementation of the five initial modules of the DST application.</p>
<p>One module was a legacy .Net full framework MVC application that was rebranded using the new DST styles while
    retaining the current, and thoroughly tested, application code. The other modules were re-written from the ground up
    using .Net Core 3.X.</p>
<p>Rollout of DST began in April 2020 and included a soft launch of the primary module, onboarding of 2300+ users, role
    assignments, and training. We further spent a sprint cycle stabilzing the modules and working through the intial
    support workload achieving a successful roll-out by April 24.</p>
