</ul>
<p>Technical details and accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Design and implementation of websites using MVC .NET, jQuery libraries &amp; plugins and token-based
        authentication using AES encryption.</li>
    <li>Design and implementation of Windows services layer that exposes services using the WCF architecture for
        communicating between customer-facing websites and services layer.</li>
    <li>Architecture designed to enforce data security model to prevent access to customer data from web servers.</li>
    <li>DTO model using XML serialization between clients and services.</li>
    <li>Developed ORM software layer using the Fluent NHibernate and the ASP.NET 2.0 provider model. Software allows for
        quick database and software development by replicating ER structures in software and abstracting the database
        routines from the developers and allowing them to work with native .Net objects instead of ADO.NET objects.</li>
</ul>

    (SMEs) to quickly develop and alter customer wizards, application flow, calculations and content to without
    involving developers or forcing code compilation.</p>
<p>Led in the recruiting and hiring strategies to build the development team. Primarily responsible for hiring several
